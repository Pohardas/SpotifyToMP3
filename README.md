# SpotifyToMP3
This Python script downloads your favorite songs from Spotify as MP3 files using yt-dlp. It connects to your Spotify account, converts the songs to MP3 format, and saves them on your computer. It keeps track of downloaded songs to avoid duplicates and can resume downloading where it left off
